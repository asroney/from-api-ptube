                <p>1. var  - Works throughout the whole function.</p>

<p> - Gets hoisted to the top of the function.</p>

<p> - Not great for limiting where you can use it. </p> <br>

<p>2. let  - Stays only within the block where you put it.</p>

<p> - Doesn't get hoisted, so you can't use it before declaring it.</p>

<p> - Good for when you want to control where your variable works.</p> <br>

<p>3.const  - Also stays within the block.</p> 

<p> - Doesn't get hoisted.</p>

<p> - Once you set it, you can't change it.</p> <br>
   <p> In easy terms, use let when you want a variable that only works where you put it, and const when you want a variable that doesn't change. Avoid using var unless you have a special reason.</p>

                <p>1. **&#96;undefined&#96;**:</p>

<p> - It often represents the absence of a value that should be there, but isn't assigned.</p>

<p> - Typically occurs when a variable is declared but not given a value or when a function doesn't return anything.</p>

<p> - It can be seen as an unintentional absence or lack of information.</p><br>

<p> 2. **&#96;null&#96;**:</p>

<p> - It's used to intentionally indicate the absence of a value or to reset a variable or object property.</p>

<p> - It's like saying, &quot;I know there should be a value here, but I'm specifically saying there isn't one.&quot;</p>

<p> - It's a way to set something to nothing or empty it out, often used for initialization or to indicate no errors or data.</p>

                What do you mean by REST API?
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content"> 
              <div>
                <p>1. **Menu**: The menu lists all the dishes you can order. In a REST API, these dishes are like &quot;resources&quot; - things you want to work with, like pictures, articles, or user profiles.</p><br>

<p>2. **Order**: When you decide what to eat, you &quot;order&quot; it from the menu. In a REST API, you make a request to &quot;order&quot; or interact with a resource using standard commands like &quot;GET&quot; to see, &quot;POST&quot; to add, &quot;PUT&quot; to update, or &quot;DELETE&quot; to remove.</p><br>

<p>3. **Waiter**: The waiter (server) takes your order and brings you the food. The server in a REST API processes your request, does the necessary work, and gives you back the result.</p><br>

<p>4. **Table Number**: Just like the waiter needs to know your table number, the server needs to know where to find the resource you want. In a REST API, each resource has a unique address called a URL (Uniform Resource Locator).</p><br>

<p>5. **No Memory**: The restaurant doesn't remember what you ate yesterday. Similarly, a REST API doesn't remember your previous requests. Each request you make should contain all the information needed.</p><br>

<p>In simple terms, a REST API is like a menu where you can order and interact with different things (resources) over the internet using standard commands. It follows rules to keep everything organized and easy to use, just like a restaurant menu.</p>
